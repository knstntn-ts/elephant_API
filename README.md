# elephant_API
Pracice exercise for using 'requests' and 'flask' to fetch info about elephants from an existing [API](https://elephant-api.herokuapp.com/) ;)

_Why did I make it?_ Purely for practice reasons. I am learning how to use Python for backend purposes, this was a nice exercise to do it.
_Why did I put it here?_ I don't really know... It was definitely not to show off :D
